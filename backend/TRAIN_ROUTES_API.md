## Usage Examples

### Python
```python
import requests

# Get all train routes
response = requests.get("https://localhost:5001/api/v1/train-routes/", verify=False)
routes = response.json()

# Search for trains
response = requests.get("https://localhost:5001/api/v1/train-routes/search?q=Rajdhani", verify=False)
rajdhani_trains = response.json()

# Create a new train route
new_route = {
    "train_number": "TEST123",
    "train_name": "Test Express",
    "from_station_code": "TEST",
    "from_station": "Test Station",
    "to_station_code": "DEST",
    "to_station": "Destination Station"
}
response = requests.post("https://localhost:5001/api/v1/train-routes/", json=new_route, verify=False)
```

### cURL
```bash
# Get all train routes
curl -k "https://localhost:5001/api/v1/train-routes/"

# Search for trains
curl -k "https://localhost:5001/api/v1/train-routes/search?q=Rajdhani"

# Create a new train route
curl -k -X POST "https://localhost:5001/api/v1/train-routes/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "train_number": "TEST123",
    "train_name": "Test Express",
    "from_station_code": "TEST",
    "from_station": "Test Station",
    "to_station_code": "DEST",
    "to_station": "Destination Station"
  }'
```

## Notes

- All endpoints require HTTPS (self-signed certificate)
- Use `verify=False` in Python requests or `-k` flag in cURL for self-signed certificates
- The API follows RESTful conventions
- All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with timezone information
- Search is case-insensitive and matches partial strings
